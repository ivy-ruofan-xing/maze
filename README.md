# Maze
The final project for the course SE 101, made by @ivy-ruofan-xing and @jenniferwills. 

This project uses the Tiva C series microcontroller board and the Orbit Booster Pack.

**Project description:** This is a game in which players tilt the board to move a ball through a maze to the exit. Before the game starts, there is a instruction page that informs players to shake the board to start. Next, players choose the difficulty level by pressing a button. The complexity of the maze increases as the difficulty level increases. At harder levels, every five seconds, a random passage of the maze is blocked and two portals are generated randomly. The time taken for the ball to reach the exit is shown after the player wins.
